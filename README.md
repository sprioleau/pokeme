Deployed URL: [pokeme-cards.netlify.app](https://pokeme-cards.netlify.app/)

## What Worked Well

### Before Lab 5 work
- Styling with Sass preprocessor
- Used functional components with hooks
- Abstracted API logic into separate file
- Digitally reproduced a Pok√©mon card
- Used 3D card effect when the card is hovered
- Interacted with [a random user API](https://randomuser.me/)
- Made use of publicly available resources for Pok√©mon data and cited in code
- Stitched together existing Pok√©mon logo with Pok√©me name
- Created card background texture
- Implemented SVG background making use of [svgbackgrounds.com](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/)

### With Lab 5 work
- Integrated with Platform API (Lab 5)
- Added filter for filtering by Pok√©Me type
- Improved 3D card look (required swapping out library) by making use of Sass mixins and the `transform: translateZ()` declaration
- ü•ö Added Easter egg for glass card style

### With Authentication Short Assignment Work
- Prevented unauthenticated users from creating new cards. I did not do this via an added `PrivateRoute` component, since a modal (not a separate route) is being used for creating/editing a card. Instead, I called `history.push("/signin")` using `react-router-dom`.

### With AWS S3 Bucket Photo Uploading
- Added support for uploading photos
- Users can either upload a photo or enter a photo URL
- A preview of the photo is shown before uploading

## What Didn't

- Would have liked to refactor the card styling so that it scales well with the browser window size
- Did not add many styles for responsiveness
- With more time, I would have added a filter by type feature on the main cards page
- Would have liked to add download screenshot functionality, so users can "keep" their cards

### Refreshing the view once data was created or updated
It took several iterations to be able to get a specific card to render once it was either created or updated. I was able to write a small component (`RefreshCard`) for refreshing the UI once card creation or updates were made. This struck me as not the best solution to the problem.

As a note, I implemented logic to keep the Redux state and database in sync. 

## Extra Credit
- Added a toast component for notifying the user for errors with API calls
- Added lots of styling to give it a Pok√©mon-inspired look and feel
- Created functionality for generating a random Pok√©Me card
- Input validation for card fields
- Added support for uploading photos

### Supercharged Title Field (as part of Lab 4 Work)
I took the lab further by ‚ö°Ô∏è supercharging the `title` field with a stringified JSON object with all the data needed to render a Pok√©Me card. I then parsed the data comping back from the database in order to render it out into the `Card` component. This approach also allowed me to store an additional `message` key, where I could store Markdown to be rendered in the UI.
